# Siphon-Forge

Quartz Clay is used to create an injection mold.

The injection mold lies beneath a magma reseviour.

The injection mold is filled with water.

Water temperature is between -110 and -200 F.

Steel Magma sits in a open-top resevoar at 14,400 F Krypton Temperature.

The most important piece of a Siphon Forge is the Hammer system.

The hammer hits above the resevour.

hammer forces magma though a one way turbine valve into injection mold.

The hammer must come down with enough force that per volume of the injection.

The final forged termperature of the injection will be 224.5 F.

238 F for Armor

297 F for best armor
