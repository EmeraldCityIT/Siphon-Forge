# Siphon-Forge

Quartz Clay is used to create an injection mold.

The injection mold lies beneath a magma reservoir.

The injection mold is filled with water.

Water temperature is between -110 and -200 F.

Steel Magma sits in an open-top reservoir at 14,400 F Krypton Temperature.

The most important piece of a Siphon Forge is the Hammer system.

The hammer hits above the reservoir.

hammer forces magma through a one-way turbine valve into an injection mold.

The hammer must come down with enough force that per volume of the injection you can "Beat the heat capacity" durign the forge.

The final forged temperature of the injection will be 224.5 F.

238 F for Armor

297 F for the best armor
